 <h1>HTML History</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Tim Berners Lee</h2>
 <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.
    <br> The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.</p>
 <hr><h3> 1980's</h3>
 <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.
    <br> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</p>
